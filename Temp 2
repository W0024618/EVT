Check below file carefully below File give us result like 

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	PersonnelType	Department	CardNumber	CardNumber_First5
239028		Employee	Denver - WU HQ	613448	61344

expected result is 
Employee Id Employee Full name , Type select only Employee , CardNumber , 
Need card number like card number Which actually have 5 digit , and card number which number is actualy 6 digit or more 
and rejection Count 

We need card details
