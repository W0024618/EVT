I implemented 10 sample scenarios in trend_runner.py. Hereâ€™s a list of 20+ you can add (copy the pattern and implement function; most rely on computed features or can be added by adding fields to compute_features):
	1.	long_gap_>=90min (done)
	2.	short_duration_<4h (done)
	3.	coffee_badging (done)
	4.	low_swipe_count_<=2 (done)
	5.	single_door (done)
	6.	only_in (done)
	7.	only_out (done)
	8.	overtime_>=10h (done)
	9.	very_long_duration_>=16h (done)
	10.	zero_swipes (done)
	11.	unusually_high_swipes (e.g., > median*3)
	12.	repeated_short_breaks (many gaps < 5 min)
	13.	multiple_location_same_day (visits recorded in multiple Partitions)
	14.	weekend_activity (swipes on Sat/Sun)
	15.	repeated_rejection_count (use Rejection_Type from raw if present)
	16.	badge_sharing_suspected (same card used by different person_uid)
	17.	early_arrival_before_06 (needs FirstSwipe field)
	18.	late_exit_after_22 (needs LastSwipe field)
	19.	shift_inconsistency (duration deviates from historical median)
	20.	trending_decline (3-week sliding avg decline)
	21.	consecutive_absent_days (zero swipes 3+ days)
	22.	high_variance_duration (std dev high vs historical)
	23.	short_duration_on_high_presence_days (duration<4h though DaysPresentInWeek high)
