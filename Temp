Refer above sql Query and build new mssql query 
expected result is 
we need 
All card numbers Employee wise 
ex- Lloyds Das (EMployee Name - and their Profile Card details ) 5 card and their Card number 

as per specific card rejection

like card number 619957 has rejected 10 time 

like

so We can identify which card rejecteed many time 
and Which employees card 

also we can indetify duplicate card number assign with diffrentv employee profile ..



so Build new logic using above Query and shre me updated mssql query carefully
