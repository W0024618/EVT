in Console its good but Evict only count when zone == Out of office so once check our logic is correct or not ..

  if (zone === 'out of office') {
    uniquePeople.delete(dedupKey);
    delete current[dedupKey];
    continue;
  }

  // Allowlist of OutDirection zones that should be kept (not evicted).
  // Add any other special OutDirection zones here as they are discovered.
  const allowedOutZones = new Set([
    'Assembly Area',
    'Reception Area'
  ]);

  // Preserve if it's an "Outer Area" OR explicitly allowed OutDirection zone.
  if (zoneRaw.endsWith('Outer Area') || allowedOutZones.has(zoneRaw)) {
    uniquePeople.set(dedupKey, PersonnelType);
    current[dedupKey] = {

      PersonnelType,
      zone: zoneRaw,

    };
  } else {
    // Any other OutDirection (TURNSTILE, lobby exits, etc.) = full eviction
    if (!warnedKeys.has(`EVICTED_OUT|${normalizePersonName(ObjectName1)}|${zoneRaw}`)) {
