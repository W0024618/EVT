Read below file Query carefully and Below Query Give me Resultt like this ...

LocaleMessageTime	Dateonly	Swipe_Time	EmployeeID	ObjectName1	PersonnelType	PartitionName2	CardNumber	AdmitCode	Direction	Door
57:36.0	20-08-2025	11:57:36 PM	326933	Moradi, Moei	Employee	LT.Vilnius	615016	Admit	InDirection	EMEA_LTU_VNO_GAMA_1st Floor_Community Space
57:11.0	20-08-2025	11:57:11 PM	326933	Moradi, Moei	Employee	LT.Vilnius	615016	Admit	InDirection	EMEA_LT_VNO_GAMA_1st Flr_Parking
49:56.0	20-08-2025	11:49:56 PM	326933	Moradi, Moei	Employee	LT.Vilnius	615016	Admit	OutDirection	EMEA_LTU_VNO_GAMA_1st Floor_Community Space

using , thier fisr swipe and last swipe for specific day ..

so for Duration Update Query and give me Updated QUery carefully..
