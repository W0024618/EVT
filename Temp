Device Health & Status Monitoring Dashboard — Java 11, Spring Boot, Microservices, Hibernate, Docker, Maven, Git
	•	Implemented backend microservices in Java 11 and Spring Boot to ingest device telemetry and expose device-health endpoints via REST APIs; applied design patterns for modularity and fault isolation.
	•	Persisted telemetry with Hibernate on an RDBMS, containerized services with Docker, managed builds using Maven and Git, and integrated the services into the CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments to JBoss.

Global Occupancy Dashboard — Java 11, Spring Boot, Microservices, REST, Hibernate, Couchbase, Docker, Maven, Git
	•	Built microservices in Java 11/Spring Boot to serve real-time and historical occupancy data through RESTful APIs, using a microservices-based aggregation layer for live and batch data.
	•	Implemented persistence with Hibernate (RDBMS) and Couchbase for fast reads/caching, containerized with Docker, used Maven/Git for build/version control, and supported automated CI/CD deployments.











Update Projects as per Job role mention only job description related skills only and upadte and give me only 2 points for each Projects carefully.
